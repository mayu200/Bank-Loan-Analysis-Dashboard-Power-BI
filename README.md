Bank Loan Analysis | Power BI, MS SQL Server | Aug 2024
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of loan applications and disbursements, utilizing MS SQL Server for data management and Power BI for data visualization. The key objectives and accomplishments include:

Data Analysis: I analyzed loan applications, identifying trends and patterns in borrower profiles and loan performance.

Dashboard Development: Created interactive dashboards with KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to provide actionable insights into the loan portfolio, including metrics on approval rates, default risks, and borrower demographics.

Advanced SQL and DAX: Leveraged advanced SQL queries for data extraction and transformation, and used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions within Power BI to efficiently process and report data.

This project showcases my ability to integrate data processing with business intelligence tools to drive data-driven decisions and enhance loan management strategies.
